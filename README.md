## About the Program
<br><p>different sorting algorithms (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Mergesort, 
Quicksort, and Heapsort) to sort N randomly generated integers and then analyze their run 
time. The project will have two parts, one for the basic implementation of the program that sorts 
the integers, and the second for analyzing what you see in terms of performance.</p>

## Purpose of the program
<br><p> The program contains several Sorting Algorithms such as Selection Sort, 
Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quicksort, and Heapsort. It is instructed to 
calculate the running time of all the sorting algorithms using only two types of an 
array which are the randomly generated array and the sorted array. Given outputs 
are expressed in seconds to sort the array. </p>
